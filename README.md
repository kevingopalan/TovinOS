# TovinOS
ver. alpha-git-rcbeta2

An OS concept on the web

## Known bugs

- Setup does not load if dark mode is toggled when setup is not finished
- When you drag windows out of the viewport, it will sort of "stick" to the cursor
- The audio will not play unless the client's audio setting for the site is set to "allow"
- The app menu will only close if you click on it
- The login inputs appear half out of the screen on some browsers

## To-do

- Refresh logo on all surfaces
- Fix bugs
- Clean up useless garbage code that is taking up space
- Finish store
- Finish Stormly first before continuing on with this project
